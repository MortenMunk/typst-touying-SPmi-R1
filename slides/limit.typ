= Limitations

---

*Cipher Sizes*
- Not superior for shorter ciphers \<128 with less frequencies
- Inefficient for longer ciphers >1500

*The paper tries a lot!*
- The model tries to do it all
- ... But it does it well!

*Where is the data from?*
- Authors use 3 different datasets + ciphers
- Hard to keep track of which and when?

They did not compare with AZDecrypt

#pause *What happens with transpositioned ciphers like Z340? #emoji.face.devil.smile*
